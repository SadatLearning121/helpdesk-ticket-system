# HelpdeskLite – Browser-Based IT Helpdesk Ticket System

HelpdeskLite is a lightweight, browser-based IT helpdesk ticket system built using **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**. It simulates a real-world IT support workflow, allowing users to create, manage, filter, and update support tickets.

This project was built as a practical demonstration of **IT support operations, ticket lifecycle management, and front-end system design**.

Features

- Create new IT support tickets
- Assign category, priority, and status
- Track ticket lifecycle: **Open → In Progress → Resolved**
- Search tickets by title or requester
- Filter tickets by status and priority
- View live ticket statistics (total, open, in progress, resolved)
- Update ticket status dynamically
- Delete tickets when resolved
- Persistent storage using **browser localStorage

Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Browser Local Storage

Purpose of This Project

This system was designed to demonstrate:
- Understanding of **IT helpdesk workflows**
- Ticket prioritisation and incident tracking
- Client-side data handling and persistence
- Basic system design thinking for IT operations

This version is a **front-end prototype**. In a real deployment, tickets would be stored in a central database via a backend API.

Future Improvements

- User authentication (admin vs requester)
- Backend API using Node.js or Python Flask
- Central database (PostgreSQL / MongoDB)
- Multi-user access
- Email notifications
